### Meetings
PiSoc holds society meetings every Monday at 18:30 in Horton D1.01

Meetings are the best place to get help with anything computer related - collectively, PiSoc has a wide range of skills in the displines of electrical engineering and computer science. Even if it's not something we're familiar with, bring your problem along and we have a crack at it!
