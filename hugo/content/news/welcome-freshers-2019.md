### Welcome to all the new freshers!

It's been a while since the last website update.

We're a society focused on computer science (occasionally maths and electrical engineering, too) - that said, anyone from any course can join.

We run events and socials - trips, gameathons (see below), and extracurricular things like lectures (hosted by experts from the industry), install parties and hackathons. We also do fun nerdy stuff from time to time, like reverse engineering bluetooth enabled kids toys and repurposing them, or hacking together [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bots when we're at the pub.

On Friday (20 / 09), we have a gameathon coming up - we'll be in Horton D1.24 from 2pm to 6pm, win some prizes by playing Xonotic (A FOSS Quake clone), Eggnogg (A FOSS 1v1 dueling game), or Worms Battlegrounds (Worms). If you're not that competitive we also have Mortal Kombat 11, [Giraffe Volleyball](https://sandwichpuissant.itch.io/giraffes-volleyball-championship-2016), [One Button Duel](https://seansleblanc.itch.io/one-button-duel), [Pinky](https://omich.itch.io/pinky), and [Blind Shootout](https://glimaleite.itch.io/blind-shootout). We'll be going to Wetherspoons afterwards for some start-of-the-semester socialising.

Later in the year, we have a trip to Bletchley Park (The home of British computer science), talks from [Rik Ferguson](https://www.infosecurityeurope.com/en/Contributors/585619/Rik-Ferguson), [Richard Hopkins](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=uk-richard.hopkins), and [Holly Grace Williams](https://www.infosecurityeurope.com/en/Contributors/8137732/Holly-Grace-Williams), building a magic mirror and a hackathon in partnership with [AI Gaming](https://www.aigaming.com/).

So, if you have questions about programming, want to learn professional skills for a career in the IT industry, or are interested in our events, come see us at the Freshers Fayre. We also run weekly meetings in Horton D1.01, between 6:30pm and 8pm.

#### We hope to see you at the fayre, on friday or at one of our regular meetings!
